title: Retrieving the App Privacy Policy
platform: android
---

An app's privacy policy is a legal document that explains how the app collects, uses, stores, and shares user data. Most apps are required to have a privacy policy, and for apps on Google Play, a link to the privacy policy is typically provided in the app's store listing. During security testing, reviewing the privacy policy helps you understand what data handling the app claims to perform, which you can then verify during your assessment.

## Overview

Privacy policies serve multiple purposes for security testing:

- Identify what types of user data the app claims to collect
- Understand stated data retention and deletion policies
- Verify compliance between stated policies and actual app behavior
- Identify third-party data sharing arrangements
- Understand the legal and regulatory framework the app operates under

The privacy policy URL can be found through the app's Google Play listing (if available) or directly within the app itself.

## Prerequisites

- The app's package ID or name (for Google Play published apps)
- Internet access
- One of the following:
    - A web browser
    - @MASTG-TOOL-0145 (google-play-scraper) for automated retrieval of Google Play apps
    - Access to the installed app to find in-app privacy policy links
    - @MASTG-TOOL-0005 (apktool) or similar tool for extracting app resources

## Steps

### For Apps Published on Google Play

#### Using a Web Browser

1. Navigate to the app's Google Play Store page:

```text
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<package-id>
```

Replace `<package-id>` with the app's package identifier. For example:

```text
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube
```

1. Scroll down to the "About this app" section or "Developer contact" section
1. Look for a "Privacy Policy" link, typically found near the bottom of the page
1. Click the link to access the privacy policy
1. Review and save the privacy policy for reference during testing

#### Using @MASTG-TOOL-0145

1. Install google-play-scraper:

```bash
npm install google-play-scraper
```

1. Create a script to retrieve the app details including the privacy policy URL:

```javascript
// get-privacy-policy.js
const gplay = require('google-play-scraper');

const appId = process.argv[2];
if (!appId) {
  console.error('Usage: node get-privacy-policy.js <package-id>');
  process.exit(1);
}

gplay.app({appId: appId})
  .then(data => {
    if (data.privacyPolicy) {
      console.log('Privacy Policy URL:', data.privacyPolicy);
    } else {
      console.log('No privacy policy URL found in the app listing');
    }

    // Optionally, print other relevant information
    console.log('\nDeveloper:', data.developer);
    console.log('Developer Email:', data.developerEmail);
    console.log('Developer Website:', data.developerWebsite);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error retrieving app data:', error.message);
  });
```

1. Run the script:

```bash
node get-privacy-policy.js com.google.android.youtube
```

1. The output will show the privacy policy URL:

```text
Privacy Policy URL: https://policies.google.com/privacy
Developer: Google LLC
Developer Email: apps-help@google.com
Developer Website: http://www.google.com/mobile
```

### For Apps Not on Google Play

If the app is not available on Google Play or you need to find the privacy policy from the app itself:

#### Check Within the App

1. Launch the app on a device or emulator
2. Navigate to the app's settings or "About" section
3. Look for links such as:
   - Privacy Policy
   - Terms of Service
   - Legal Information
   - About
4. Follow the link to access the privacy policy
5. Note the URL or take screenshots if it's displayed in-app

#### Extract from App Resources

Some apps bundle privacy policy information within their resources. You can extract this using @MASTG-TOOL-0005:

1. Decompile the APK:

```bash
apktool d app.apk -o app_decompiled
```

1. Search for privacy policy URLs in the decompiled resources:

```bash
cd app_decompiled
grep -r "privacy" res/values/strings.xml
grep -r "policy" res/values/strings.xml
grep -r "http" res/values/strings.xml | grep -i "privacy\|policy"
```

1. Look for URL patterns in the app's configuration files:

```bash
grep -r "privacy" AndroidManifest.xml
grep -r "http.*privacy" .
grep -r "http.*policy" .
```

1. Check common resource files:

```bash
# Check string resources
cat res/values/strings.xml | grep -i "privacy\|policy"

# Check network security config if present
cat res/xml/network_security_config.xml
```

#### Search Developer Website

1. If the app listing provides a developer website, visit it
1. Look for "Privacy Policy", "Privacy", or "Legal" links, typically found in the footer
1. Developer websites often host privacy policies at common paths:
    - `https://developer-domain.com/privacy`
    - `https://developer-domain.com/privacy-policy`
    - `https://developer-domain.com/legal/privacy`
    - `https://developer-domain.com/terms`

## Understanding Privacy Policies

When reviewing a privacy policy for security testing purposes, focus on:

### Data Collection

- What types of data are collected (personal, device, usage, location, etc.)
- When data collection occurs (on install, during use, in background)
- Whether collection is mandatory or optional
- What permissions are required for data collection

### Data Usage

- How collected data is used (analytics, advertising, app functionality)
- Whether data is used for profiling or automated decision-making
- If data is used for purposes other than core app functionality

### Data Sharing

- Whether data is shared with third parties
- Types of third parties (analytics providers, advertisers, service providers)
- Whether data is sold to third parties
- International data transfers

### Data Storage and Security

- Where data is stored (local device, cloud servers, geographic location)
- How long data is retained
- Security measures in place (encryption, access controls)
- Whether data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### User Rights

- How users can access their data
- Whether users can request data deletion
- How to opt-out of data collection or sharing
- How to contact the developer regarding privacy

## Validation

Use the privacy policy as a reference during testing to:

1. **Verify declared data collection**: Use network traffic analysis, file system monitoring, and API hooking to confirm what data is actually collected matches the privacy policy claims
2. **Test data sharing**: Monitor network traffic to identify third-party domains and verify they match disclosed third parties
3. **Verify security claims**: Test encryption implementation, secure storage practices, and data transmission security
4. **Validate user controls**: Test whether opt-out mechanisms and data deletion features work as described
5. **Check for undisclosed collection**: Look for data collection not mentioned in the privacy policy

Common discrepancies to investigate:

- Apps collecting sensitive data not mentioned in the privacy policy
- Third-party SDKs transmitting data to undisclosed parties
- Data retention periods exceeding stated policies
- Missing or non-functional data deletion capabilities
- Unencrypted transmission of sensitive data despite security claims

## Caveats and Limitations

- Privacy policies are legal documents that may use vague or broad language
- Policies may be updated after app publication without notification
- Not all apps are required to have a privacy policy (though Google Play generally requires one)
- Privacy policies may not cover all technical implementation details
- Some apps may not provide direct access to their privacy policy
- Apps distributed outside official app stores may not maintain accessible privacy policies
- Privacy policy language may vary by jurisdiction
