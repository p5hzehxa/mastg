## Overview

App Transport Security (ATS) only applies to connections made via the [URL Loading System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system) (typically `URLSession`). Lower-level networking APIs bypass ATS entirely, meaning they can establish cleartext HTTP connections regardless of the app's ATS configuration.

The following low-level APIs are not affected by ATS:

- **[`Network` framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network)**: A modern low-level networking API for socket-level communication using TCP and UDP.
- **[`CFNetwork`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cfnetwork)**: Core Foundation-based networking APIs including `CFSocketStream`, `CFHTTPStream`, and related functions.
- **BSD Sockets**: Low-level POSIX socket APIs accessed through functions like `socket()`, `connect()`, `send()`, and `recv()`.

Apple [recommends](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing_insecure_network_connections) preferring high-level frameworks: "ATS doesn't apply to calls your app makes to lower-level networking interfaces like the `Network` framework or `CFNetwork`. In these cases, you take responsibility for ensuring the security of the connection. You can construct a secure connection this way, but mistakes are both easy to make and costly. It's typically safest to rely on the URL Loading System instead."

For more information on when ATS applies, see @MASTG-KNOW-0071.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0065 to reverse engineer the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0072 to look for uses of low-level networking APIs in the app binary.
3. Use @MASTG-TECH-0076 to analyze the relevant code paths and determine if they could establish cleartext connections.

## Observation

The output should contain a list of low-level networking API usages and their locations within the app binary.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the app uses low-level networking APIs to establish cleartext connections.

Additional analysis is required to confirm whether cleartext connections are actually made:

- **Review the context**: Determine if the low-level API usage involves cleartext (HTTP/unencrypted) or encrypted (TLS/HTTPS) connections.
- **Check TLS configuration**: If using `Network` framework, verify that TLS is properly configured using `.tls` parameter in `NWParameters`.
- **Cross-reference with dynamic analysis**: Perform network traffic interception (see @MASTG-TEST-0236) to confirm whether cleartext traffic is actually transmitted.
