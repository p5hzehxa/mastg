## Overview

This test checks for references to `WebViewClient` URL interception methods that override the default page navigation behavior in WebViews. The default and safest behavior on Android is to let the default web browser open any link that the user clicks inside the WebView. However, this can be modified by configuring a `WebViewClient` with custom URL handling logic.

The following interception callback methods are relevant:

- [`shouldOverrideUrlLoading`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient#shouldOverrideUrlLoading(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest)): allows the application to either abort loading WebViews with suspicious content by returning `true` or allow the WebView to load the URL by returning `false`. Note that this method is not called for POST requests, XmlHttpRequests, iFrames, "src" attributes in HTML, or `<script>` tags.
- [`shouldInterceptRequest`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient#shouldInterceptRequest(android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.WebResourceRequest)): allows the application to return custom data from resource requests. This callback is invoked for various URL schemes (e.g., `http(s):`, `data:`, `file:`), but not for `javascript:` or `blob:` URLs, or for assets accessed via `file:///android_asset/` or `file:///android_res/`.

If these methods are implemented without proper URL validation, the app may load content from untrusted sources or navigate users to malicious websites.

See @MASTG-KNOW-0018 for more information on URL loading in WebViews.

## Steps

1. Run @MASTG-TECH-0014 on the app and look for classes extending `WebViewClient` and implementing URL interception methods.

## Observation

The output should contain a list of locations where `WebViewClient` URL loading handlers are used, including:

- Classes extending `WebViewClient` with `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` or `shouldInterceptRequest` implementations.
- Calls to `setWebViewClient` on `WebView` instances.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if `WebViewClient` URL interception methods are implemented without proper validation of the URLs being loaded. Inspect each implementation to verify that:

- URLs are validated against an allowlist of trusted domains.
- Navigation outside trusted domains is prevented or handled securely.
- The implementation does not inadvertently allow loading of malicious content.

Note that using a `WebViewClient` is not inherently insecure. The test fails only when the URL handling logic does not properly restrict navigation to trusted content.
