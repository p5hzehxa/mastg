### Sample

This demo is a placeholder and needs to be implemented.

setUserAuthenticationRequired()

**Note:** This flag only applies when the key requires biometric authentication (not device credentials). If `setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(-1)` is set (requiring authentication per use) with biometric authentication, this flag should be considered.
